## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **Why does `POST()` connect `Community 0` to `Community 1`, `Community 2`, `Community 3`, `Community 4`, `Community 5`, `Community 8`, `Community 10`, `Community 11`, `Community 15`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.284) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `GET()` connect `Community 0` to `Community 1`, `Community 2`, `Community 3`, `Community 4`, `Community 5`, `Community 6`, `Community 7`, `Community 8`, `Community 10`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.274) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `now()` connect `Community 2` to `Community 0`, `Community 10`, `Community 4`, `Community 6`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.068) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Are the 50 inferred relationships involving `POST()` (e.g. with `appendDailyLog()` and `getCommunitySignals()`) actually correct?**
  _`POST()` has 50 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Are the 53 inferred relationships involving `GET()` (e.g. with `getStrategyLog()` and `runSkillLifecycleTransitions()`) actually correct?**
  _`GET()` has 53 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
